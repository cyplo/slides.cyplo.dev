# Rust in 2019

# The most loved language in the Stack Overflow survey.

<Notes>
Think of a Language that would make you feel that.
Okay to interrupt
What do you look for when choosing a programming tool ?
What makes you "like" a programming language ?
Think of tools, ecosystem, community.

# Community-first

* tools are a part of the experience
* people really eager to help
* lotta crates
* rusty puns
* documentation is excellent
* new compiler version every 6 weeks, always backwards compatible

"I only work with languages with names starting with `Ru-` now" < Steve Klabnik

<Notes>
Rust founders were acutely aware of this, and added community tools early
* github - development in the open, listening to feedback
* rfc process, on github as well
* forums, irc
* podcasts
* Rust thanks

It is very often. It is very stable as well.
crater, big query

"
We will use a variation of the train model, first introduced in web browsers and now widely used to provide stability without stagnation:
New work lands directly in the master branch.
Each day, the last successful build from master becomes the new nightly release.
Every six weeks, a beta branch is created from the current state of master, and the previous beta is promoted to be the new stable release.
In short, there are three release channels – nightly, beta, and stable – with regular, frequent promotions from one channel to the next.

# Usage in the wild

* CDNs - Fastly, Cloudflare, AWS through WASM
* Critical paths in large codebases - VLC, Firefox, Dropbox
* Your favourite CLI tools - ripgrep, fd, lsd, bat, etc
* Embedded devices

"For a long while now I’ve been worried that the GNOME project would struggle to grow its contribution and stay attractive if it stuck to C in the long run (i.e. next 10-20 years)." - Alberto Ruiz

## ~~Package~~  ~~Build~~ World manager

```bash
$ cargo new hello
   Created binary (application) `hello` package
$ cd hello/
$ cargo run
   Compiling hello v0.1.0 (/home/cyryl/temp/hello)
   Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.23s
   Running `target/debug/hello`

Hello, world!

$ git status
   On branch master
```

Let's spend a bit more time on this slide
You can read it not knowing Rust
Let's take it in, read every line, see if you understand what's going on
Questions ?

Representing results
Nil/Null/Handle without a value is not a thing in Rust

# Rust

* no gc
* no inheritance
* no segfaults*
* no data races*
* no null
* no exceptions
* predictable latency
* predictable memory usage
* puns

##### *when you don't use `unsafe` blocks

---

* unique memory model
* steep initial learning curve - pair program !
* powerful ecosystem
* code ages well
* compiler is your friend
* code generation is easy (safe macros, build.rs)
* cool and weird and useful
* nice people
* you should try it

Depending on your learning style, you might like some better than the other;

- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rustlings/rustlings) - This is a good set of starter exercises if you want to have a feeling for the language - have links to relevant book sections for each exercises so you can either start with the book or trying to figure it out yourself first. Ah, and it uses the Playground, which means you don't need to install anything on your machine to start.
- [The book itself](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/second-edition/index.html) - Second edition. Good when you want a solid baseline understanding of the language first.
- [Rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/) - An set of examples that are runnable within a browser, intertwined with explanatory prose.
- [Exercism](http://exercism.io/)’s Rust exercises - a CLI app that guides you through exercises of increasing difficulty.
- [IntoRust](http://intorust.com/) - A set of short screencasts for the foundational topics.
