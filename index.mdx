# Rust in 2019

---

# The most loved language in the Stack Overflow survey.

<Notes>
Think of a Language that would make you feel that.
Okay to interrupt
What do you look for when choosing a programming tool ?
What makes you "like" a programming language ?
Think of tools, ecosystem, community.

# Community-first

* tools are a part of the experience
* people really eager to help
* lotta crates
* rusty puns
* documentation is excellent
* new compiler version every 6 weeks, always backwards compatible

"I only work with languages with names starting with `Ru-` now" < Steve Klabnik

<Notes>
Rust founders were acutely aware of this, and added community tools early
* github - development in the open, listening to feedback
* rfc process, on github as well
* forums, irc
* podcasts
* Rust thanks

It is very often. It is very stable as well.
crater, big query

"
We will use a variation of the train model, first introduced in web browsers and now widely used to provide stability without stagnation:
New work lands directly in the master branch.
Each day, the last successful build from master becomes the new nightly release.
Every six weeks, a beta branch is created from the current state of master, and the previous beta is promoted to be the new stable release.
In short, there are three release channels – nightly, beta, and stable – with regular, frequent promotions from one channel to the next.

# Usage in the wild

* CDNs - Fastly, Cloudflare, AWS through WASM
* Critical paths in large codebases - VLC, Firefox, Dropbox
* Your favourite CLI tools - ripgrep, fd, lsd, bat, etc
* Embedded devices

## ~~Package~~  ~~Build~~ World manager

```bash
$ cargo new hello
   Created binary (application) `hello` package
$ cd hello/
$ cargo run
   Compiling hello v0.1.0 (/home/cyryl/temp/hello)
   Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.23s
   Running `target/debug/hello`

Hello, world!

$ git status
   On branch master
```

Let's spend a bit more time on this slide
You can read it not knowing Rust
Let's take it in, read every line, see if you understand what's going on
Questions ?

Representing results
Nil/Null/Handle without a value is not a thing in Rust

# Let's see some real-life projects

---

# Summary

* no gc
* no inheritance
* no segfaults*
* no data races*
* no null
* no exceptions
* predictable latency
* predictable memory usage

##### *when you don't use `unsafe` blocks

---

# Summary

* unique memory model
* steep initial learning curve - pair program !
* powerful ecosystem
* code ages well
* cool and weird and useful
* you should try it

```
